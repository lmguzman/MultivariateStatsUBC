# Fundamental principles

- Dimensional analysis can be used to simplify equations into dimensionless variables. 
- This type of analysis only works on dimensionally homogeous equations -> have the same dimensions. 

# Example:

Let's estimate the drag experimenced by an object immersed in a current.

Assumptions:
- The immersed object is a smooth sphere.
- The velocity of the current V is constant. 

The drag force F is a function of:
- velocity `(V)`
- diameter of the sphere `(D)`
- density of water `(p)`
- dynamic viscosity `(n)`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
F = f(V,D,p,n)
```

* Dimensional analysis allows one to find the form of the equation that relates F to the variables identified as governing the drag*
