# Multidimensional Analysis

- First: Characterize the data matrix in terms of a simplified structure (Clustering or ordination)
- Second: Interpret the phenomenon underlying the data matrix. 

# Clustering and ordination

- Use the same similarity or distance matrix for cluster and ordination analysis
- Represent ordination clustering onto ordination diagrams
- Only use primary connections 

# Direct or indirect comparison?

- Indirect: Original data is transformed via ordination or clustering and then compared via regression or correlation.
- Direct: Canonycal analysis, matrix correlation, comparison of dendograms. 

# Objectives of interpretation

- Explanation (or discrimination) 
- Forecasting
- Prediction 

# Exlaining (discrimination) (table 10.1)

Main objective: data exploration not hypothesis testing
